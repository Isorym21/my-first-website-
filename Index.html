<p> <b>Abortion</b> is a controversial topic because it is a medical or surgical procedure that ends a pregnancy before an embryo or fetus is born. Today, abortion is a major problem for women, although it has been stated for years that abortion should not be legal. Many people believe that murdering or aborting an unborn fetus should be against the rules. On the other hand, others have no idea what abortion is, who may have it, and why people would like to have it. Human life, I believe, begins at conception, and that the human fetus is a child with a right to life. As a result, when it comes to abortion, I am against it.

A large number of laws prohibit abortion., though some allow it for a limited time. Legal abortions are performed in two ways: one using medications to abort, and the other using an invasive surgical technique. 
The majority of pregnancies that are terminated are ended in the first three months of pregnancy. According to a survey, 88.6 percent of abortions occur during the first trimester, 10.2 percent occur during the second trimester, and 1.1 percent occur during the third trimester. Some people believe that abortion is a form of child murder. They believe the government does not promote the death of embryos or fetuses.

 Some, on the other hand, are proponents of freedom of choice. They agree that it should be up to the mother to decide whether or not to carry the pregnancy. Any pregnant woman has the option to retain or terminate her birth. Some people argue that abortion is only acceptable if the fetus is risky to the mother and may result in her death, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.

    There is a heated controversy between pro-abortion and anti-abortion viewpoints. Political and religious viewpoints are also included. Abortion is seen differently by different people, and, as a result,  they make different decisions. About 58 million abortions are committed worldwide per annum. Per year, unsafe abortions with dangerous equipment result in almost 4,700 deaths and 5 million hospitalizations.

    Abortion is performed in many rural areas using unscientific techniques and crude treatments that can endanger the mother's life. According to estimates from 2010 to 2014, abortion is a major problem in Africa, taking the lives of 26000 people each year. Since abortion is illegal in some parts of Africa and can't destroy the embryos with a doctor's support, about 8.6 million women have sacrificed their lives for abortion in non-scientific ways. In Africa, 34 women of every 1000 had an abortion. Every year, millions of women pursue medical attention through risky procedures, which may cause major health issues in the mother and harm her family, including all other children. It can be observed, in countries where abortion is legal, women receive adequate medical care and their lives are not jeopardized. However, in most parts of Africa, abortion by dangerous means is a way of life.

    According to Marquis, Abortion is gravely morally wrong because it is the act of murdering a human being with a right to life, and murdering a human being with a right to life is gravely morally wrong because it deprives the being of their future, particularly one with such great importance as ours. Marquis explains why killing someone is incorrect in whatever circumstance. He believes that the fetus will grow up to be an autonomous human being with a future close to ours. Therefore, Marquis argues that since the loss of the future is the propelling factor that makes traditional murder crimes wrong, this same loss of the future makes abortion wrong. It appears that the same arguments used to oppose abortion are also used to oppose contraceptives. Contraception does not seem to be ineffective. At the very least, if contraception is immoral, it isn't as evil as murder.

    The moral argument on abortion focuses on whether or not a fetus should be treated as a human being and should be protected, while the legal debate centers over whether the fetus has a legitimate right to life. In the course of determining whether or not the various reasons for abortion are acceptable justifications for the procedure. Abortion is wreaking havoc on our society. People kill their unborn children for several absurd reasons. It is deliberate and cold-blooded murder. Most women give reasons for abortion, such as not wanting to be a single mother, financial insecurity, family troubles, or being physically unprepared for pregnancy at this moment. Take for example a young teenager who has been brutally raped. Is it fair to ask her to go ahead and have the baby because she is the biological mother, though she never intended to get pregnant and was literally forced to? Her school, work, and mental health will all be in disarray as a result of this. Obviously, forcing her into motherhood at such a young age would be unjust. As a result, in situations like this, a rape victim does not have to abort the baby if she doesnâ€™t want to deliver it. She can carry the pregnancy to term and then give the baby up for adoption or foster care. It is not the product of the incestuous, abusive relationship that should be punished, but rather the abuser in that non-consensual relationship. Abortion results in the death of a person. It kills the baby's body as well as the mother's soul, and there is never an option.
