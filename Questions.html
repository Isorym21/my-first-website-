 <h2><li>What exactly is an abortion? </li></h2>

 <h2><li>Why do women have abortions? </li></h2>

<p> Women have abortions for several causes, including traumatic experiences, bad marriages that affect their emotions, health reasons,  and rape victims. </p>

 
 <h2><li> How safe is an abortion? </li></h2>

<p> Abortion is not safe, as the pregnancy progresses, the risk of complications increases, and the woman can have mental health issues or even die. </p>


 <h2><li>Do people regret having an abortion? </li></h2>

<p> Abortions are chosen because it is the only choice available to them and their families. Some women, on the other hand, come to regret their choices over time. Terminating a pregnancy was initially a tough choice for them.
 </p>

 <h2><li>Are you considering and an abortion? </li></h2>

<p> I advise you not to kill the fetus. An embryo is a human being, regardless of how it was born, and intentionally destroying a human being's life without justification is never acceptable. </p>
